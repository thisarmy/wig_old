Cleaned up style:

* All tabs replaced with 4 spaces and I tried to deal with the fallout caused by that.
* no space between 'function' and '('
    (but this is not crockford-compliant)
* *//* -> */\n\n/*
* removed some trailing whitespace
* standardized on new Array() rather than mix with []
    (but this is not crockford-compliant. at least it is consistent now.)
* standardized on new Object() rather than mix with {}
    (ditto)


Removed things I didn't need:

* Extjs
* Repository
* Plugin
* Ribbon
* FloatingMenu
* i18n (because there's now no UI in the core)
* commented out code
* code that's no longer referenced (already marked as moved with a TODO)
* all plugins
* standardized on $.trim() and $.inArray()


Minor little hacks here and there:

* enter inside empty list element didn't work for my test data
